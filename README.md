# Introduction
PhotoStream is a dynamic photosharing website that let's users share images with each other, follow other accounts, commenting on posts and liking and saving posts. Beyond photo sharing, it also allows users to communicate through messaging, and also to uphold community standards by reporting inappropriate content.
