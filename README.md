# Portfolio Project 5 (Code Institute) - Advanced Front End
## Introduction
PhotoStream is a dynamic photosharing website that let's users share images with each other, follow other accounts, commenting on posts and liking and saving posts. Beyond photo sharing, it also allows users to communicate through messaging, and also to uphold community standards by reporting inappropriate content.

## Design
### Colors
I have chosen 3 main colors for my page, these are:
#0b0b0b, a dark, almost black color
#efede6, a light beige color
#7b6557, a brown color
#ffffff
These colors are used for most of the buttons, the text as well as the Navbar. 

### Font
I have used Montserrat in my project, which is a popular sans-serif font among designers, and is available on Google Fonts.
